General Notes:
The .vscode is not part of the project. I prefer to keep so that I don't have to re-create it.
Should work on linux or macOS but was only tested on windows with gcc using c++14.

1) To build : ./makefile.sh

2) To Run : Output/a.exe

or) build and run:  ./makefile.sh && Output/a.exe

3) Run test: ./runTests.sh

Improvements: There is a bug in Managed2DArray removing duplicate which can cause seg fault.

To do: 

1) need to update makefile.sh to include Tree.cpp
2) write down step to finish project in this readme.md
